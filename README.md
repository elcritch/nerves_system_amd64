# Nerves Image for AMD64 / x86-64 systems

WIP! Mainly I'm curious how a Nerves system would handle building Elixir specific images for AWS and GCE type VM's.
Given that Elixir deployment story is still somewhat in flux, it makes for an interesting way to possibly deploy
code on EBS and GCE or micro-container systems. For example, it may be easy to modify the system to produce micro-containers.
